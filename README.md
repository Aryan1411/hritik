# Hritik Sharma — Portfolio

MIT Licensed single‑page portfolio for Hritik Sharma, an Aerospace Engineer and Astronaut. It features an aesthetic, performant space scene with animated rockets launching and orbiting planets, alongside professional information, skills, experience, and contact options.

## Overview
- Elegant, responsive, and fast: loads without external assets.
- Interactive space background:
  - Twinkling stars and gradient planets (one with a ring).
  - Rockets periodically launch from the bottom and others fly in orbit around planets.
  - Press “L” or click “Launch Rocket” to spawn a new launch.
- Content sections:
  - Hero with role, summary, and quick actions.
  - About, Experience, Core Skills, Missions/Projects, and Contact with a simple form.
- Accessibility:
  - Respects “prefers-reduced-motion” (disables canvas animations for users who prefer less motion).

## Setup
No build steps are required.

- Option 1: Double-click index.html to open in your browser.
- Option 2: Serve locally for best performance:
  - Python: python3 -m http.server 8000
  - Node (serve): npx serve
  - Open http://localhost:8000 (or the port your server prints).

## Usage
- Navigate via the sticky header to jump between sections.
- Click “Launch Rocket” or press the L key to launch an animated rocket.
- Use the contact form to submit a message (demo alert). Replace the mailto and form handling as needed.
